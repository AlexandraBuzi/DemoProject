   <h1>Beginning of horror films </h1>
   <h3>Frankenstien 1910</h3>
   <p> One of the first Horror films was an interpritation of frankenstien. It was by the edison kintogram, made in 1910. The plot simply is that a medical student tries to make a human through alchemy. Instead he creates a monster. The monster (Frankenstein) runs off. Later on the wedding night Fankenstein see's a monster in the mirror (his reflection) but through love it fades to a human being. Its a bit of a magical,sweet ending and not the usual ending of terror we expect from horror movies.</p>
